# My-Tech-Blog
Description
"My Tech Blog" is a node.js application that allows users to create a new post, like a post, and comment on a post. The application leverages Express.js as the server and Sequelize as the ORM to interact with a MySQL database.

Installation
Clone the repo to your local machine using https://github.com/bhamilton68/my-tech-blog.git.

Ensure that Node.js is installed in your environment.

Then follow these steps:

Run npm install in the root directory to install the project dependencies.

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

arduino
Copy code
DB_NAME='database_name'
DB_USER='your_username'
DB_PW='your_password'
SESSION_SECRET='your_secret'
In the root directory, run node server.js.

You should see the server start and print "Now listening on port 3001".

Usage
Once the server is running, open your browser and visit http://localhost:3001/. You should see the homepage load with a list of blog posts.

Features of the blog include:

User login/registration and session management, including encrypted password storage.
Ability for logged-in users to create new posts.
Ability for logged-in users to like and comment on existing posts.
Post filtering based on category.
Blog posts have associated metadata such as author, date, total likes, and category.
Posts display a "Read More" option if the post exceeds a certain length.
Users can edit or delete their own posts.
